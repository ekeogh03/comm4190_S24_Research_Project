# COMM4190 Spring 2024 - Tutor vs LLM Research Project

# Emmy Keogh

Welcome to my Tutor vs. Large Language Models Research Project for Communication 4190: Talking with AI; Computational and Communication Approaches. In this repository, you will find my process of examining a specific communicative context (in this case, the relationship and communication between a tutor and a middle school student) and exploring how LLMs might be used in this context in the future. I will also discuss the associated implications. This scenario came to mind because I have witnessed the transition of tutoring from an in-person experience to virtual options, and now, with Artificial Intelligence models providing answers at the tips of their fingers, it seems logical that LLMs will become the next tutors. However, the complexity of maintaining a relationship of trust and recognition with a tutor, alongside the challenge of not immediately sharing answers, will be difficult for these LLMs. Please check out the links for my final paper, annotated bibliography, and prompts with LLMs below. Thank you and enjoy!
